# dbg
`dbg` aims to be an offline debugger.


## Features
- Offline debugging: runs the program live and collects program state information such as variable values after executing each line in the source code. This information is stored in a "trace" file that can later be replayed. 
- Offline debugging will also enable timeless debugging, users will be able to "step backwards" in the code.
